Abstract peer to peer client transport API. Implementations based on WebRTC and webSocket to be done.

## API specification (*warning*: early state)

### Facade

#### attributes

- **onPeerJoining**: function (new: *Peer*, oneOfMy: *Network*)
  * When the *new* peer has joined *oneOfMy* network.


- **onPeerLeaving**: function (left: *Peer*, oneOfMy: *Network*)
  * When the *left* peer has disconnected from *oneOfMy* network.


- **onBroadcastMessage**: function (from: Peer, to: Network, data: string)
  * When a message has arrived from on the network (someone in the network sent a broadcast message).


- **onPeerMessage**: function (from: *Peer*, data: *string*)
  * When some peer in the network has sent a message only to you.


- **onJoinRequest**: function (from: *Peer*,  requestData: *Object*)
  * When some peer in the network has sent you a join request via network. This peer wants you to join one of his network with which you are not connected yet. (see ***Peer.acceptJoinRequest*** and ***Peer.rejectJoinRequest***)

#### methods

- **create** (topology: *string*): *Network*
  * Create a new peer to peer network.


- **connect** (serverURL: *string*): *Promise*
- **.then** (function (net: *Network*)): *Promise*
- **.catch** (function (err: *string*)): *Promise*
  * Connect to a network with server help (LINK...)


- **join** (serverURL: *string*): *Promise*
- **.then** (function (net: *Network*)): *Promise*
- **.catch** (function (err: *string*)): *Promise*
  * Join network with server help. *serverURL* is obtained from a peer which started inviting (LINK...).


- **sendJoinRequest** (to: *Array [Peer]*, oneOfMy: *Network*)
  * Send join request message to peers via network to ask them to join *oneOfMy* network.
